## Scenario
The final project for PROG2100 C++ course was to create a modified 2D predator-prey simulation that can display a cyclical pattern between the population of predators and prey.

## Challenge
There were many chances to run into compiling errors trying to build such a complicated program.

In order to find out the causes, I learned how to use the  debugger more efficiently, for example, I observed both the console and the value watcher at the same time. 

Later I realized most of errors were caused by referring null objects, so I pre-emptively tried to avoid such mistakes.

## Outcome
The program worked perfectly and managed to maintain a good balance between the population of both predator and prey. The teacher was very content with this result as well.
